<Task 1.> 


Let's imagine a situation: you went to the market and filled your baskets (basket1 and basket2) with fruits. 
You wanted to have one of each kind but realized that some fruits were put in both baskets.


1. Your first task is to remove everything from basket2 that is already present in basket1. 

2. After the removal it is reasonable to anticipate that one of the baskets might weigh more compared to the
 another (all fruit kinds weight the same). Therefore, the second task is to transfer some fruits from a heavier 
 basket to the lighter one to get approximately the same weight/amount of fruits.

--------------- Done! -----------------

Task 2. 
Your task is to create a regular expression matching a valid temperature represented either in Celsius 
or Fahrenheit scale (e.g. '+23.5 C', '-4 F', '0.0 C', '73.45 F') and to extract all the appearances 
from the given string text. Positive temperatures can be with or without the + prefix (e.g. '5 F', '+5 F'). Negative temperatures must be prefixed with -. Zero temperature can be used with a prefix or without.

Tips:
The + symbol within the square brackets [] matches the +symbol itself (e.g. the regular expression [1a+] matches to '1', 'a', or '+'). 

You can also apply ? to the characters within the square brackets [] to make the set optional (e.g. [ab]? matches to 'a', 'b', or '').
