I attended the fulltime remote bootcamp for UX/UI design with Ironhack. The experience was intense due to the tight planning, I learned a lot and I think the best factors were the dedicated and supportive teaching team, great fellow students and the focus of the schedule on practicing the new skills immediately. If possible, I would recommend doing the part time class, to give your brain the possibility to absorb the new knowledge also over a bit more time.
Ironhack came into my life when I wanted to up-skill and divert my career into somthing more creative. The UX/UI design bootcamp is a fast paced course to get into the tech industry. In 9 weeks you will learn how to implement design thinking and visual designing. With the mentoring available by the end of the Cohort you will have a prepared portfolio to dive into the job market. The remote team is amazing and I enjoyed every minute of the course. 100% recommended!
The content itself can be found elsewhere. What makes this training particular is how this information is presented and applied, the pedagogy. But, above all, it is who you learn, share and evolve with, the networking. You learn through projects and with a diverse range of people with unique and rich professional and personal backgrounds. From the first project, you apply the theory previously seen and get to know your peers, and as you do, you become aware of your own personal and professional evolution. You can experiment with different roles so you can see what part of Ux design you want to focus on later. And you will be accompanied in your job search... from how to define your professional needs, how to present yourself, how to negotiate up to the point of finding something that fits you. Hope You are going to find this useful.
In my first experience with code I achieve my objects and now I am graduate. It was a great experience, non had previous knowledge it was difficult but with hard work I passed my assessment, class works and proyects! Maybe it is better had previous experience

I signed up for the Ironhack Part Time Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp having heard good things about it and, actually, they were all right. The teaching staff that I had the pleasure to learn with was highly skilled, supportive and taught us excellently, all while also having fun and even some good laughs. I was excited everyday before starting a new class. This bootcamp is demanding, at times you might feel like to much input is going into your mind, however they will provide many tools and resources in order for you to succeed, grow and learn a ton. I couldn´t be happier about the choice and its results. 100% recommended!
The teachers are great, I had a great experience which not only includes the excellent curriculum but all the activities that are planned for it to be smooth and fun. i was nervous for it to be a full time remote bootcamp but I am not dissapointed at all. I would definetly recommend it to anyone.
This course has been amazing and I couldn't imagine I would have learnt so much in so little time. I strongly recommend it to everybody who is interested in data analysis and data science. If you put down the work it will pay off!! So try to follow the lessons and trust the process, you will learn so much!
