After having an overview of the data, I drop the column Department because it's always the same
department. I transformed every number to an integer and all to lower case. I decide to replace 
missing values with the most frequent values because it's not gonna change a lot our data but we have
to take into account that we're gonna have two more clients which have Manager as a profession 
and two more clients with the oldest age. It depends on the case, but maybe it's better to remove
them, but we're on time to do it if we want to.
I used ordinal encoding for the column risk and labels for the column profession.
