Project Description

We were sad to learn that Grandmaâ€™s recent password was hacked! To help her in better securing her online accounts, we decided to create Strong Passwords Generator.

Rules

Strong Passwords Generator is based on below input coming from the user (Grandma): 1 word that is familiar to her (max 8 characters) 1 important year from her life (max 4 characters, in example 1989)

Input is transformed into string, that is later alternated following below format:

1 letter of word
1 digit of number
1 additional special character (depending on the lengths of the word might be more by the end)
In example:

User INPUT: Word : damian Year : 1995

Python OUTPUT (password): D 1 \ A 9 / M 9 : I 5 *a ? N < >
